% \textbf{Applications:} GANs have been used in a wide spectrum of applications, \citet{bicycle} used \textit{Bicycle} GAN to map an input image to multiple different output images, see Fig.\ref{fig:bicycle}.

%--------------------------------- DCGAN training 
% \begin{algorithm*}
% \begin{algorithmic}[1]
% \FORALL{Epochs}
% \FORALL{Batches, x}
% \STATE Generator forward with a batch of random latent vectors ($z\ \in P_z; P_z=N(0,1)$) and generate a batch of fake images (Fake).
% \STATE Discriminator forward with two batches, one real (dense arrow) and one fake (dashed arrow). Output realism probability (D(x), D(G(z))).
% \STATE Calculate D loss using equation (1). Backpropagate and update D parameters using gradient decent.
% \STATE Calculate G loss for the fake batch using eq (2). Backpropagate and update G parameters using gradient decent.

    these images are taken from epochs 0, 65, 170, 235, 249, where the input was fixed to four latent vectors. The horizontal axis is the training iterations, the verticla one is for binary cross entropy loss. }

% In the US, 1 in every 8 women is projected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime with a positive diagnosis rate of one every 2 minutes and death rate of one every 13 minutes. The approximate total number of breast-cancer-related deaths in the US only in 2019 is 42,260 \citep{US_stats}.
