# Master Thesis
This is where I put code + utilities related to my Master's thesis in Erasmus Mundus in Medical Imaging and Applications.
## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Realistic Data Augmentation and Lesion Simulation in X-ray Breast Imaging.
I this work DCGAN was used to generate mammographic patches (128 X 128 pixels).

1. DCGAN Training 
The following Figure shows the process of training the DCGAN.

2. Results
In this figure we evaluate the performance of using the DCGAN as an augmentation tool as a function of the trinaing size.
