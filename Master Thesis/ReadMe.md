# Master Thesis
This is where I put code + utilities related to my Master's thesis in Erasmus Mundus in Medical Imaging and Applications.
## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Realistic Data Augmentation and Lesion Simulation in X-ray Breast Imaging.
I this work DCGAN was used to generate mammographic patches (128 X 128 pixels).

* DCGAN Training 
The following Figure shows the process of training the DCGAN.
